Welcome to my 401k projection calculator. This calculator is a proof of concept to illustrate the ease and convienence to spin up a project using Ruby on Rails. Currently, it takes in a few inputs (initial account balance, expected age of retirement, rate of return and inflation rate). Most online sites use clientside Javascript to calculate these figures, however, there are advantages to storing data for quick and pain-free retrieval.
